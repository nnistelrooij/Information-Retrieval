# Information-Retrieval
Repository for research project of the 2019 Information Retrieval course at Radboud University in Nijmegen.

The `dict`, `docs`, `terms`, and `qrels` tables can now be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cp0nnr91rdv5np7/Robust04Tables.rar?dl=0). These are based upon the index with one leaf, so most problems should now be fixed.
